## How to use

### Windows

If you're using Windows, follow these steps to compile and run the program:

1. Download the source code from the repository.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the source code.

3. Use the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile the code. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc file_name.c -o file_name
    ```

   Replace `file_name.c` with the name of the C source file you downloaded and `file_name` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

4. Compile the C++ file using GCC with the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name
    ```

   Replace `file_name.cpp` with the name of the C++ source file you downloaded and `file_name` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

5. After successful compilation, you can run the program by executing the generated executable:

    ```bash
    ./file_name
    ```

### Linux

Linux users have a couple of options for running the program:

**Option 1: Using Precompiled Binary**

1. Download the precompiled executable file for your system from the repository.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the executable.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    ./file_name
    ```

   Replace `file_name` with the name of the downloaded executable.

**Option 2: Compiling from Source**

1. Download the source code from the repository.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded source code.

3. Compile the C file using GCC with the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc file_name.c -o file_name
    ```

   Replace `file_name.c` with the name of the C source file you downloaded and `file_name` with the desired name for the compiled executable.
4. Compile the C++ file using GCC with the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name
    ```

   Replace `file_name.cpp` with the name of the C++ source file you downloaded and `file_name` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

5. After successful compilation, you can run the program by executing the generated executable:

    ```bash
    ./file_name
    ```
